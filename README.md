# Morphclock

an animated time and date display (logo included).

## Getting Started

The animated glyphs are drawn with metapost and converted to SVG paths by a node script. A pdf file is created on the fly that shows the glyphs drawn in a grid.

### Prerequisites

You need metapost and lualatex as well as node.js.

```
$ sudo apt install texlive-luatex texlive-metapost npm nodejs
$ npm install terser -g
```

The glyphs and the pdf output are created by
```
$ make test
```

the complete JavaScript file ready for inclusion into html documents is generated by
```
$ make all
```

Example html files for testing are included in this repository and online at https://hohlart.de/morphclock/.

## Contributing

If you want to enhance the clock by either

* adding glyphs for different languages (currently supported abbreviations: us, de)
* adding different time zones
* adding different sync methods

## Acknowledgments

* Thanks to Dr. Martin Gutbrod ([PTB](https://www.ptb.de)) who coded the websocket interface and allowed me to use parts of his code for this project. The websocket interface is now located in a separate file, so the clock can be used with and without connection to the PTB timeserver.
